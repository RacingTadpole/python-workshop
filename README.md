# python-workshop

## Agenda

* Static typing in Python with mypy
* Docstring testing with pytest
* Jupyter notebooks
* Other packages that make your life easier such as "attrs", "radon".
* Make your code easy to read by defining your own iteration or call method (`__iter__`)
* A short intro to numpy and pandas for "scientific computing".
* Annoying practical setup stuff: pipenv, Pipfiles vs setup.py, basic directory structure, importing stuff, pip -e.
* Generators

## Quick start

### Install PyCharm or equivalent

Install PyCharm or a similar editor. A vanilla text editor is fine too.

### Install Python and pipenv

See the [pipenv documentation](https://docs.pipenv.org/install/) for the steps to install python 3, pip and pipenv.

On a Mac, you will need to install python 3 as described above (python 2 is the default).
The simplest way to install `pipenv` is to install homebrew, and then type `brew install pipenv`.
 
On linux, this [link](https://packaging.python.org/install_requirements_linux/#installing-pip-setuptools-wheel-with-linux-package-managers)
may be helpful.

### Install the Required Packages

Enter the `python-workshop` directory, and type:

```
pipenv install --dev
```

This creates an environment containing the required packages, which you enter by typing:

```
pipenv shell
```

### Run the tests

In the pipenv environment, make sure this command runs without error:

```
bin/check_code
```

### Open Jupyter lab

In the pipenv environment, type:

```
jupyter lab
```

### Use this repo as a template for your own python project

You can clone this repo, and type

```
bin/rename foo_bar
```

to get it ready to use as a project named "foo_bar".

Note to finish the process properly, you should then do the following:
    1. `rm -rf .git`
    2. Update `README.md`
    3. Update the description and author in `setup.py`
    4. `git init && git add --all && git commit -m 'initial commit'`
